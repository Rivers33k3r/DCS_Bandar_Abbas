## SORTIE: Operation MeatValley

## SITUATION ##
It's War.
Iran 2 days ago has crossed the strait of Hormuz approaching Oman coasts from the north.
Troops have landed to Khasab and after a brief battle the city, port and airfield were conquered.

The northern part of Oman territory is now heavily guarded by Iranian Navy and Cavarly. 
Numerous armored platoons were disembarked during the night; these units are now moving south to secure Sall Ala Rd and the valley.
North Oman forces are bottled in the eastern part of the penisula, around Sall Ala, trying to hold the frontline. 
Heavy fire is reported accross the area, with many casualties during the retreat.
US Troops have renamed the combat field as "Meatvalley", the tarrain is under artillery fire from both sides.
Saudi Arabia is moving its army and US is joining the conflict providing support to allies.
The US Stennis is in the Oman gulf, other american squadrons are dislocating in the United Arab Emirates airfields.
Since no official UN resolution is on the table, for the moment only French and UK have joined the blue coalition.
French M2KC are providing caps and UK Harrier have just arrived in the area. 

Blue forces are still examinating the situation, trying to find the ideal battleplan.
Since Oman forces in Sall Ala have counted minutes, the blue coalition decided to rush a combined operation in the valley.
The objective is to destroy enemy artillery, attack red ships in Khasab port and suppress SAM stations in the are before they reach a more advantageous position.

The Iranin move was unexpected, the world is shocked but we are not: we have a job to do.

## Some notes:

This is my first "released" miz, so please be gentle. One day i will get better :P

This mission is not too heavily scripted but be sure to reach the wp 3 and MARSHALL there till it's the right moment to ingress.
Our Normandy Ticaragua class is giving support to the operation launching cruise missile against forces in Khansab.

Khasab is heavely defended and the valley is even more dangerous. 
Frontline is espected to be around the village of Ghubn Hamad.

Divert airfield is at Fujairah Intl. (it's not a shame to land there, it's just your choice since case 1 with no light could be pain).
Be sure to contact Stennis and ask for a landing. There should be some traffic and lights always help...
