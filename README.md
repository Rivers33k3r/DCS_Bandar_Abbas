this is just some fun in dcs mission editor and gulf map.

I am storing here some missions created in DCS mission editor.
The objective is to have some fun in gulf map sharing these missions.
This stuff is not intended to be super realistic or historically accurate: for me dcs is just fun so take it easy.
I plan to create at least 10 missions describing the war between Iran and Saudi Arabia.
We are going to fly USA F-18 in a multirole squadron.

Any sort of help is welcome, from debugghing to scripting o mission editing.
