## Some notes:

This mission is not too heavily scripted but bet sure to reach the wp 3 and MARSHALL there till it's the right moment to ingress.
Our Normandy Ticaragua class is giving support to the operation launching cruise missile against force in Khansab

Khasab is heavely defended and the valley is even more dangerous. 
Frontline is espected to be around Ghubn Hamad.

DIvert airfiled is at Fujairah Intl. (it's not a shame to land there, it's just your choice)

Miz version 0.6
This mission is using MOOSE for CAP and CGI orchestration.
This version of this mission is without RAT, to check performances.
